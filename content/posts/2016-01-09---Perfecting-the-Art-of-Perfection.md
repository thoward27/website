## Why C++

* 2nd in Average Salary (Indeed.com): $115k
* Extremely Fast (Beat Java/Go/Scala according to Google
* Offers low-level functionality, with object-oriented tools
* Can be used to build almost anything

## Evolution of C++

* Developed during 1969-1973 in Bell Labs
* Acts as a layer of abstraction over assembly
* Is extremely flexible, but offers no protection
* Very small feature set
* Compiled with gcc


```C
/* Hello World */
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {	
    printf(“Hello, world!\n”);	
    return 0;
}
```
