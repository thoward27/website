## Grade & Gradelang

Grade and Gradelang focus on solving the problem of autograding in computer science.
Traditional tools have leaned heavily on packages such as [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), which lacks many features and characteristics that would truly make it ideal as an autograding solution.
While there have been light-hearted attempts at simplifying this process, Grade attempts to be the best solution.
Gradelang leverages grade, providing a Domain-Specific Language focused entirely on autograding.

## Clustered Learning of Approximate Manifolds (CLAM)

In this work we aim to learn the manifold of high dimensionality data.
Building off of the work done for [CHESS](https://github.com/nishaq503/CHESS), we are building out a rust-backed implementation of the core divisive-clustering algorithm.
Our goal is to provide sub-linear time searches, sub-linear memory compression, and to explore what can be done with the learned manifold.
