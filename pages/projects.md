## R<sup>3</sup>

In the US, 9/10 individuals with Intellectual/Developmental Disabilities (IDD) will experience at least one instance of abuse.
Moreover, individuals with I/DD are generally at a higher risk of violence, such as assault or other violent crimes, than individuals without disabilities.
Yet, incidents of abuse against individuals with I/DD remains severely under reported.
For example, *only 3\% of sexual abuse cases involving persons with I/DD are **ever** reported*

R<sup>3</sup> is a native application designed to refresh knowledge of abuse for individuals with intellectual/developmental disabilities.
Its goal is to empower neurologically atypical individuals to identify and report abuse when it happens.
The application is written in Dart/Flutter; development is still active, source code is not yet available.

## Grade & Gradelang

Grade and Gradelang focus on solving the problem of autograding in computer science.
Traditional tools have leaned heavily on packages such as [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), which lacks many features and characteristics that would truly make it ideal as an autograding solution.
While there have been light-hearted attempts at simplifying this process, Grade attempts to be the best solution.
Gradelang leverages grade, providing a Domain-Specific Language focused entirely on autograding.

## Clustered Learning of Approximate Manifolds (CLAM)

In this work we aim to learn the manifold of high dimensionality data.
Building off of the work done for [CHESS](https://github.com/nishaq503/CHESS), we are building out a rust-backed implementation of the core divisive-clustering algorithm.
Our goal is to provide sub-linear time searches, sub-linear memory compression, and to explore what can be done with the learned manifold.
